## Description

It only feels natural that the final homework assignment really tested my capabilities with all the elements that we  have learned in the last 12 weeks. This was an effort that required a strong understanding of State, CRUD, and lots of tutorials. 

Building the database was a real test of my patience and persistence. Most importantly, it was a test of teamwork with my fellow classmates. A lot of time was spent trying to understand how ARRAY_AGG worked, and how we could join and aggregate information. It was a great lesson in learning how to properly use this kind of aggregate functions. 

The second lesson that was a tough obstacle to over come was how to click on an object, GET the data for that object, populate state with that data, and get it to post to a brand new page... whew. Once again this was an instance of a lot of trial and error and utilizing tutorials. I learned a lot about when to call on state.
